# unit-4-crystal-game
A kind of blackjack game with crystals.

Game is a redesign from suggested layout. When loaded a "Show Instructions" button allows the user to read how to play the game. Once displayed a "Hide Instructions" button appears to toggle. A "Reset" button exists for the user to reload the game at any time, thus zeroing out their wins and losses.

When a game is won or lost, a "Play Again" button appears, which initializes the random number, total score, and message. Attention was given to the crystal random number array that values are unique. 

A Bootstrap version may follow.
